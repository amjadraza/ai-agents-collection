        "This notebook demonstrates how to create and utilize a ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) agent using LlamaIndex. The ReAct agent is designed to interact with various tools, starting with simple arithmetic operations and progressing to more complex tasks like querying financial data from Uber and Lyft's 10-K filings. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to setting up the agent, integrating tools, and performing queries, making it a valuable resource for understanding how to build intelligent agents for task automation and data analysis.\n",
