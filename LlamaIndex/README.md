# Building and Testing a ReAct Agent with LlamaIndex

## Overview

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates how to build and test a ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) agent using LlamaIndex. The notebook covers the creation of a ReAct agent with simple tools (e.g., arithmetic operations) and extends its capabilities by integrating QueryEngine tools for querying financial data from Uber and Lyft's 10-K filings.

## Key Features

- **ReAct Agent Setup**: Learn how to create a ReAct agent and integrate it with simple tools like arithmetic operations.
- **QueryEngine Integration**: Extend the agent's capabilities by integrating QueryEngine tools to query financial data from Uber and Lyft's 10-K filings.
- **Hands-On Examples**: Step-by-step examples of how to use the agent to answer complex questions by combining reasoning and tool usage.
- **Prompt Inspection**: Explore the prompts used by the agent to select and interact with tools.

## Installation

To run this notebook, you need to install the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install -qU llama-index llama-index-llms-gemini llama-index-embeddings-huggingface
```

## Usage

1. **Set Up API Keys**: Ensure you have the necessary API keys (e.g., Gemini API key) and configure them in the notebook.
2. **Define Tools**: Start by defining simple tools (e.g., arithmetic operations) and integrate them with the ReAct agent.
3. **Query Financial Data**: Use the QueryEngine tools to query financial data from Uber and Lyft's 10-K filings.
4. **Run Queries**: Test the agent by running queries and observing how it reasons and acts to provide answers.

## Example Queries

- **Simple Arithmetic**: "What is 20 + (2 * 4)? Calculate step by step."
- **Financial Data**: "What is Lyft's core business model, and how does it generate revenue?"
- **Comparative Analysis**: "Compare and contrast the revenue growth of Uber and Lyft in 2021, then give an analysis."

## Notebook Structure

1. **Installation**: Install required Python packages.
2. **Setup API Keys**: Configure API keys for the Gemini model.
3. **Define LLM and Embedding Model**: Set up the language model and embedding model.
4. **Create ReAct Agent**: Build a ReAct agent with simple tools.
5. **QueryEngine Tools**: Integrate QueryEngine tools for financial data querying.
6. **Run Queries**: Test the agent with various queries.
