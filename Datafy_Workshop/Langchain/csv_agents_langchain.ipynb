        "# LangChain CSV Analysis Agent with Groq LLM\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "This Jupyter notebook implements an intelligent CSV analysis system using LangChain and the Groq LLM (specifically the llama-3.3-70b-versatile model). The system is designed to perform natural language-based analysis on salary data, allowing users to query the dataset conversationally without writing explicit code.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Goals\n",
        "1. **Data Analysis Automation**: Create an AI-powered agent capable of analyzing a salary dataset (`salaries_2023.csv`) using natural language queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Enhanced Query Accuracy**: Implement a robust verification system through custom prompts that:\n",
        "   - Requires multiple calculation methods for verification\n",
        "   - Enforces data formatting standards (comma-separated numbers)\n",
        "   - Demands explanation of methodologies used\n",
        "   - Prevents hallucination by requiring calculations based only on available data\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Interactive Interface**: Provide two ways to interact with the data:\n",
        "   - Direct Python interface for programmatic access\n",
        "   - Streamlit web interface for user-friendly interaction (currently commented out)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features\n",
        "- Integration with Groq's LLM through LangChain\n",
        "- Pandas DataFrame agent for data manipulation\n",
        "- Custom prompt engineering for accurate responses\n",
        "- Built-in error handling and result verification\n",
        "- Markdown formatting for clear result presentation\n",
        "- Support for complex analytical queries about salary data, including:\n",
        "  - Departmental salary analysis\n",
        "  - Gender pay comparison\n",
        "  - Grade-based salary analysis"

We calculated the average `Base_Salary` for each department using the `groupby` function and then found the department with the highest average salary using the `idxmax` function. The result was confirmed using another method, which involved resetting the index of the `department_avg_salary` dataframe and finding the row with the maximum `Base_Salary`. Both methods yielded the same result, indicating that the IGR department has the highest average salary of 165,196.75. \n",
